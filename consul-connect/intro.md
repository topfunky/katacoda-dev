In this hands-on lab, you'll start two services and connect them over a secure proxy with Consul Connect.

The front end will be a dashboard that displays a number. The backend will be a counting service that increments a number every time it is asked for one.

We've configured Consul for you, so it's ready to go. Let's get started!
