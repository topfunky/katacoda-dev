# Introduction to Nomad

In this guide, you'll learn what Nomad is and how to run one or more instances of a `redis` server with it.

We have pre-configured a single node Nomad and Consul environment. Using the terminal window built into this tutorial you will be able try out many of Nomad's fantastic features. First we are going to take a look at how you can run a simple job in Nomad.

If you are already familiar with the basics of Nomad, the [documentation](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/index.html) provides a better reference guide for all available features as well as internals.
